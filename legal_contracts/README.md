Access the Legal Contract from the Blockchain

Some of the features that I've tried to implement are :

* Access the soft-copy of the legal document stored on IPFS
* Ability to record that the parties have signed to contract
* Limited access control

# TODO

- [ ] Separate data and logic using storage contract
- [ ] Create REST-API wrapper to access the smart contract from outside
- [ ] Populate this README with more instructions
